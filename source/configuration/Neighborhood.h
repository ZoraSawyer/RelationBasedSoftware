 * @note Depending on the constitutive model, Neighborhood may require storing different properties along with the neighbors.
 * @note If you need to introduce new form of neighborhood, use this class as a public base class and then implement the required properties.
 * @warning Avoid using this class directly in your simulation. For each supported constitutive model, there should be subclass of this class.
